Changes needed to convert scipy to work with the new scipy core.

done * scipy_distutils and scipy_base to scipy.disutils and scipy.base
done * Numeric/arrayobject.h to scipy/arrayobject.h
done * Numeric/ufuncobject.h to scipy/ufuncobject.h
* Look for use of descr->zero and descr->ones --- need to be replaced


Changes that should be made someday:

* io rewritten to use internal writing capabilities of arrays
* distributions heavy use of extract and insert (could use fancy indexing -- but we should wait until we learn how slow fancy indexing is....)
* Use of old Numeric C-API.  Using it means an extra C-level function cal think that's a problem,  but...
* Make use of type addition to extend certain ufuncs with cephes quad types.
