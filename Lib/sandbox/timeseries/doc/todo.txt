To-do:
	===================================================================
	These are not necessarily things that I am personally going to do,
	but would be nice to have none-the-less :)
	===================================================================

	- add a "basis" option to the convert method. Possible values are
	  'business' or 'daily'. This would be used in determining the weights
	  of the months, quarters, etc when converting things with
	  observed='AVERAGED' (right now, it always assumes equal weighting)
	  
	  This should also be an attribute of each TimeSeries object that would
	  provide the default behaviour if the basis option was not specified.

	- add time series specific concepts/functions like moving averages, MACD, moving
	  standard deviation, seasonal analysis, etc...

	- add support for more frequencies: semi-annual, decade, and maybe even
	  sub-frequencies like quarterly with quarters ending on months other than
	  Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec, weekly ending on different days of the the week, etc...

	- additional unit-tests
	
	- documentation

Wishlist:

	- pytables submodule for reading and writing timeseries objects directly
	  to/from HDF5 databases
