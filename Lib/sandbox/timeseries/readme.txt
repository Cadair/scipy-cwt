Requirements and warnings:

1. version 2.0.x of the mx DateTime module MUST be installed. Only "tested" with 2.0.3
2. Only tested with numpy 1.0.1
3. Only tested with Python 2.4.x
4. Only tested on Windows Platform
5. the included cseries.pyd file was compiled for 32-bit windows, so if you are trying
   this on another platform, the first thing you need to do is recompile it
   

Instructions:

1. read through the included example.py script in the examples subfolder. This illustrates
   the basic functionality of the module. I recommend placing print statements after each
   variable assignment, one at a time, to see the result of each item in the examples.
   
   Documentation is very limited, so the examples really are the best starting point.
   
2. Before you get too crazy and start modifying the examples and writing your own scripts,
   please read todo.txt in the doc subdirectory for an outline of limitations in the current
   module.
