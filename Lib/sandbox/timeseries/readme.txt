Requirements and warnings:

1. version 2.0.x of the mx DateTime module MUST be installed. Only "tested" with 2.0.3. The cseries
   code requires access to a couple of the header files included with this module when compiling
2. Only tested with numpy 1.0.1
3. Only tested with Python 2.4.x
4. Only tested on Windows and x86_64 Platform
5. Requires maskedarray from the sandbox (not the standard masked array module with numpy)
   

Instructions:

1. read through the included example.py script in the examples subfolder. This illustrates
   the basic functionality of the module. I recommend placing print statements after each
   variable assignment, one at a time, to see the result of each item in the examples.
   
   Documentation is very limited, so the examples really are the best starting point.
   
2. Before you get too crazy and start modifying the examples and writing your own scripts,
   please read todo.txt in the doc subdirectory for an outline of limitations in the current
   module.
