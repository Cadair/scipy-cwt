#2006-12-09: - Code reorganization: define 2 modules, core and extras
#2006-11-25: - Disable copy by default
#            - Added keep_mask flag (to save mask when creating a ma from a ma)
#            - Fixed functions: empty_like
#            - Fixed methods: .any and .all 
#            - New functions: masked_all, masked_all_like
#            - New methods: .squeeze
#2006-11-20: - fixed make_mask 
#            - fixed nonzero method
#2006-11-16: - fixed .T
#2006-11-12: - add max, min as function (not only method...)
#            - repr returns a name like masked_xxx, where xxx is the subclass
#2006-10-31: - make sure that make_mask returns a pure ndarray.
#2006-10-30: - When converted to a float, a masked singleton is transformed to nan 
#              instead of raising an exception.
#21: Use __get__ method in _arraymethods, _arithmethods, _compamethods
#18: Updated put to match the definition of numpy 1.0, deleted putmask, changed resize
#2: prevent an extra kword being sent to make_mask_none
