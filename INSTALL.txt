PREREQUISITES
=============

SciPy requires the following software installed:

1) Python 2.1.x or 2.2.x (see NOTES 1)
     http://www.python.org
2) Numerical Python 20.x or 21.x
     http://www.numpy.org/
3) ATLAS 3.3.14 or newer (see NOTES 2 and 3) or 
   ATLAS 3.2.1 (see NOTES 2 and 4)
     http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/
4) f2py 2.13.175-1250 or newer
     http://cens.ioc.ee/projects/f2py2e/
5) C, C++, Fortran 77 compilers.
   gcc 2.95.x compilers are recommended
     http://gcc.gnu.org/

The following software is optional:

6) FFTW 2.1.x
     http://www.fftw.org/
7) wxPython
     http://www.wxpython.org/

NOTES
-----
1) Python must be build with zlib module enabled.

2) Complete lapack library is required when using ATLAS, see
     http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html#completelp
   for instructions.

3) If you are willing to sacrifice the performance (by factor of 5 to
   15 for large problems) of the linalg module then it is possible to
   build SciPy without ATLAS. For that you'll need either Fortran
   LAPACK/BLAS libraries installed in your system or Fortran
   LAPACK/BLAS sources to be accessible by SciPy setup scripts (use
   LAPACK_SRC/BLAS_SRC environment variables to indicate the location
   of the corresponding source directories).

4) If you are using ATLAS 3.2.1 then set
     atlas_version_pre_3_3 = 1
   in scipy/linalg/setup_linalg.py before building SciPy.

GETTING SCIPY
=============

See
   http://scipy.org/

Development version from CVS
----------------------------
See
   http://www.scipy.org/site_content/tutorials/CVSInstruct
Daily snapshot of SciPy CVS repository is available in
   ftp://scipy.org/pub/


INSTALLATION
============

From a tar ball
---------------
Unpack SciPy-<version>.tar.gz, change to SciPy-<version> directory,
and run

   python setup.py install

This can take several minutes to hours, depending on the speed of your
computer.

XXX: From rpm,deb,zip,..


TESTING
=======

To test SciPy installation, run in python

   >>> import scipy
   >>> scipy.test(level=1)

where the test level can vary from 1 to 10.


KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============

BLAS sources shipped with LAPACK are incomplete
-----------------------------------------------
Some distributions (e.g. Redhat Linux 7.1) provide BLAS libraries that
are built from such incomplete sources and therefore cause import
errors like

  ImportError: .../fblas.so: undefined symbol: srotmg_

Fix
  Use ATLAS or the official release of BLAS libraries.

LAPACK library provided by ATLAS is incomplete
----------------------------------------------
You will notice it when getting import errors like

  ImportError: .../flapack.so : undefined symbol: sgesdd_

To be sure that SciPy is built against a complete LAPACK, check the
size of the file liblapack.a -- it should be about 6MB. The location
of liblapack.a is shown by executing

    python scipy_distutils/system.py

Fix
  Follow the instructions in

    http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html#completelp

  to create a complete liblapack.a. Then copy liblapack.a to the same
  location where libatlas.a is installed and retry with scipy build.


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

If you experience problems when building/installing/testing SciPy, you
can ask help from scipy-user@scipy.org or scipy-dev@scipy.org mailing
lists. Please include the following information to your message:

1) Platform information:
     python -c 'import os,sys;print os.name,sys.platform'
     uname -a
     OS, its distribution name and version information
     etc.
2) Information about C,C++,Fortran compilers/linkers as reported by
   the compilers when requesting their version information, e.g.,
   the output of
     gcc -v
     g77 --version
3) Python version:
     python -c 'import sys;print sys.version'
4) Python Numeric version:
     python -c 'import Numeric;print Numeric.__version__'
5) f2py version:
     f2py -v
6) ATLAS version, the locations of atlas and lapack libraries, building
   information if any.
7) The output of the following commands
     python scipy_distutils/system_info.py
     python scipy_distutils/command/build_flib.py
8) Feel free to add any other relevant information. For example, the
   full output (both stdout and stderr) of the SciPy installation
   command can be very helpful.
