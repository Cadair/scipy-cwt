SciPy 0.8.0 Release Notes
=========================

.. contents::

SciPy 0.8.0 is the culmination of 6 months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.8.x branch, and on adding
new features on the development trunk.  This release requires Python
2.4 - 2.6 and NumPy 1.3 or greater.

Please note that SciPy is still considered to have "Beta" status, as
we work toward a SciPy 1.0.0 release.  The 1.0.0 release will mark a
major milestone in the development of SciPy, after which changing the
package structure or API will be much more difficult.  Whilst these
pre-1.0 releases are considered to have "Beta" status, we are
committed to making them as bug-free as possible.  For example, in
addition to fixing numerous bugs in this release, we have also doubled
the number of unit tests since the last release.

However, until the 1.0 release, we are aggressively reviewing and
refining the functionality, organization, and interface. This is being
done in an effort to make the package as coherent, intuitive, and
useful as possible.  To achieve this, we need help from the community
of users.  Specifically, we need feedback regarding all aspects of the
project - everything - from which algorithms we implement, to details
about our function's call signatures.

Python 3.0
----------

Python 3.0 is not supported at all; it requires NumPy to be ported to
Python 3.0.  This requires immense effort, since a lot of C code has
to be ported.  The transition to 3.0 is still under consideration;
currently, we don't have any timeline or roadmap for this transition.

Major documentation improvements
--------------------------------

SciPy documentation is greatly improved.

New features of the fftpack package
-----------------------------------

New realtransforms have been added, namely dct and idct for Discrete Cosine
Transform; type I, II and III are available, for both single and double
precision.

fft functions can now handle single precision inputs as well: fft(x) will
return a single precision array if x is single precision.
