SciPy 0.8.0 Release Notes
=========================

.. contents::

SciPy 0.8.0 is the culmination of XXX months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.8.x branch, and on adding
new features on the development trunk.  This release requires Python
2.4 - 2.6 and NumPy 1.3 or greater.

Please note that SciPy is still considered to have "Beta" status, as
we work toward a SciPy 1.0.0 release.  The 1.0.0 release will mark a
major milestone in the development of SciPy, after which changing the
package structure or API will be much more difficult.  Whilst these
pre-1.0 releases are considered to have "Beta" status, we are
committed to making them as bug-free as possible.  For example, in
addition to fixing numerous bugs in this release, we have also doubled
the number of unit tests since the last release.

However, until the 1.0 release, we are aggressively reviewing and
refining the functionality, organization, and interface. This is being
done in an effort to make the package as coherent, intuitive, and
useful as possible.  To achieve this, we need help from the community
of users.  Specifically, we need feedback regarding all aspects of the
project - everything - from which algorithms we implement, to details
about our function's call signatures.

Python 3
========

Python 3 compatibility is planned and is currently technically
feasible, since Numpy has been ported. However, since the Python 3
compatible Numpy 2.0 has not been released yet, support for Python 3
in Scipy might not yet be included in Scipy 0.8.

Major documentation improvements
================================

SciPy documentation is greatly improved.

Deprecated features
===================

Swapping inputs for correlation functions (scipy.signal)
--------------------------------------------------------

Concern correlate, correlate2d, convolve and convolve2d. If the second input is
larger than the first input, the inputs are swapped before calling the
underlying computation routine. This behavior is deprecated, and will be
removed in scipy 0.9.0.

New features
============

DCT support (scipy.fftpack)
---------------------------

New realtransforms have been added, namely dct and idct for Discrete Cosine
Transform; type I, II and III are available, for both single and double
precision.

Single precision support for fft functions (scipy.fftpack)
----------------------------------------------------------

fft functions can now handle single precision inputs as well: fft(x) will
return a single precision array if x is single precision.

Correlation functions now implement the usual definition (scipy.signal)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The outputs should now correspond to their matlab and R counterparts, and do
what most people expect if the old_behavior=False argument is passed:

* correlate, convolve and their 2d counterparts do not swap their inputs
  depending on their relative shape anymore;
* correlation functions now conjugate their second argument while computing
  the slided sum-products, which correspond to the usual definition of
  correlation.

Additions and modification to LTI functions (scipy.signal)
----------------------------------------------------------
* The functions `impulse2` and `step2` were added to `scipy.signal`.
  They use the function `scipy.signal.lsim2` to compute the impulse and
  step response of a system, respectively.
* The function `scipy.signal.lsim2` was changed to pass any additional
  keyword arguments to the ODE solver.

Improved waveform generators (scipy.signal)
-------------------------------------------
Several improvements to the `chirp` function in `scipy.signal` were made:

* The waveform generated when `method="logarithmic"` was corrected; it
  now generates a waveform that is also known as an "exponential" or
  "geometric" chirp. (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirp.)
* A new `chirp` method, "hyperbolic", was added.
* Instead of the keyword `qshape`, `chirp` now uses the keyword
  `vertex_zero`, a boolean.
* `chirp` no longer handles an arbitrary polynomial.  This functionality
  has been moved to a new function, `sweep_poly`.

A new function, `sweep_poly`, was added.

New functions and other changes in scipy.linalg
-----------------------------------------------
The functions `cho_solve_banded`, `circulant`, `companion`, `hadamard` and
`leslie` were added to `scipy.linalg`.

The function `block_diag` was enhanced to accept scalar and 1D arguments,
along with the usual 2D arguments.

The function `solveh_banded` no longer returns the Cholesky factorization.  It
returns just the solution.

ARPACK-based sparse SVD
-----------------------

A naive implementation of SVD for sparse matrices is available in
scipy.sparse.linalg.eigen.arpack. It is based on using an symmetric solver on
<A, A>, and as such may not be very precise.

Better behavior for `scipy.constants.find` (scipy.constants)
------------------------------------------------------------
The function `scipy.constants.find` was modified to return the list of keys
that it finds, instead of printing them and returning None.

Incomplete sparse LU decompositions
-----------------------------------

Scipy now wraps SuperLU version 4.0, which supports incomplete sparse LU
decompositions. These can be accessed via `scipy.sparse.linalg.spilu`.
Upgrade to SuperLU 4.0 also fixes some known bugs.


Removed features
================

scipy.stsci: the package was removed

scipy.signal.chirp:

* The `qshape` keyword argument was removed.  Instead, use the `vertex_zero`
  argument.
* `chirp` no longer handles the case of a general polynomial.  This
  functionality has been moved to a new function, `sweep_poly`.
