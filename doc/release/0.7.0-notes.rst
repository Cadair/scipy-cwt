=========================
SciPy 0.7.0 Release Notes
=========================

This is a new stable release.  Please note that unlike previous versions
of SciPy, this release requires Python 2.4 or greater.  This release also
requires NumPy 1.2.0 or greater.

Changes
-------

Sparse Matrices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* added support for integer dtypes such ``int8``, ``uint32``, etc.
* new class ``dia_matrix`` : the sparse DIAgonal format
* new class ``bsr_matrix`` : sparse Block CSR format
* new sparse matrix construction functions

 * ``sparse.kron`` : sparse Kronecker product
 * ``sparse.bmat`` : sparse version of ``numpy.bmat``
 * ``sparse.vstack`` : sparse version of ``numpy.vstack``
 * ``sparse.hstack`` : sparse version of ``numpy.hstack``

* extraction of submatrices and nonzero values

 * ``sparse.tril`` : extract lower triangle
 * ``sparse.kron`` : extract upper triangle
 * ``sparse.find`` : nonzero values and their indices

* ``csr_matrix`` and ``csc_matrix`` now support slicing and fancy indexing

 * e.g. ``A[1:3, 4:7]`` and ``A[[3,2,6,8],:]``

* conversions among all sparse formats are now possible

 * all formats have member functions such as ``.tocsr()`` and ``.tolil()``

* sparse constructors now accept dense matrices and other sparse formats

 * e.g. ``A = csr_matrix( rand(3,3) )`` and ``B = lil_matrix( [[1,2],[3,4]] )``

* efficiency improvements to:

 * format conversions
 * sparse matrix arithmetic

* numerous bugfixes

Reworking of IO package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The IO code in both NumPy and SciPy is undergoing a major reworking. NumPy
will be where basic code for reading and writing NumPy arrays is located,
while SciPy will house file readers and writers for various data formats
(data, audio, video, images, matlab, excel, etc.).  This reworking started
NumPy 1.1.0 and will take place over many release.  SciPy 0.7.0 has several
changes including:

* many of the functions in scipy.io have been deprecated
* the Matlab (TM) file readers/writers have a number of improvements:

 * default version 5

New Hierarchical Clustering module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module adds new hierarchical clustering functionality to the
cluster package. Its interface is similar to the hierarchical
clustering functions provided in MATLAB(TM)'s Statistics Toolbox to
facilitate easier migration to the NumPy/SciPy framework. Linkage
methods implemented include single, complete, average, weighted,
centroid, median, and ward. Several functions are provided for
computing statistics on clusters including inconsistency statistics,
cophenetic distance, and maximum distance of descendants. The fcluster
and fclusterdata functions take hierarchical tree clusterings
generated by these algorithms, cuts the tree, and labels the flat
clusters. The leaders function finds the root of each flat cluster
given a hierarchical clustering and labellings of its leaves. Finally, a
matplotlib extension is provided for plotting dendrograms, which
may be outputted to postscript or any other supported format.

New Spatial package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Collection of spatial algorithms and data structures useful for spatial
statistics and clustering applications. Includes fast compiled code for
computing exact and approximate nearest neighbors, as well as a pure-python
kd-tree with the same interface but that supports annotation and a variety
of other algorithms. The API for both modules may change somewhat as user
requirements become clearer.

Also includes a submodule ``distance`` containing fast code for many definitions
of *distance* between vectors.  These common distance functions are useful for
for many agorthms including spatial statistics, clustering, and kd-trees.
Distance and dissimilarity functions provided include Bray-Curtis, Canberra,
Chebyshev, City Block, Cosine, Dice, Euclidean, Hamming, Jaccard, Kulsinski,
Mahalanobis, Matching, Minkowski, Rogers-Tanimoto, Russell-Rao,
Squared Euclidean, Standardized Euclidean, Sokal-Michener, Sokal-Sneath,
and Yule. Two functions are provided for computing distances between
collections of vectors: ``pdist`` and ``cdist``. ``pdist`` is similar to the
MATLAB(TM) function and computes pairwise distances between a collection of
vectors. ``cdist`` computes distances between vectors in two sets of vectors.
``squareform`` converts between square distance matrices and condensed
distance matrices.

Reworked fftpack package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FFTW2, FFTW3, MKL and DJBFFT wrappers have been removed. Only (NETLIB)
fftpack remains. By focusing on one backend, we hope to add new
features -- like float32 support -- more easily.

New Constants package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Collection of physical constants and conversion factors.

New Radial Basis Function module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

http://scipy.org/scipy/scipy/browser/trunk/scipy/interpolate/rbf.py

New complex ODE integrator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``scipy.integrate.ode`` now contains a wrapper for the ZVODE
complex-valued ordinary differential equation solver
(by Peter N. Brown, Alan C. Hindmarsh, and George D. Byrne).

Major documentation improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TODO

Bug fixes in the interpolation package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The shape of return values from ``scipy.interpolate.interp1d`` used
to be incorrect if interpolated data had more than 2 dimensions and
the axis keyword was set to a non-default value. This is fixed in 0.7.0:

    http://projects.scipy.org/scipy/scipy/ticket/289
    http://projects.scipy.org/scipy/scipy/ticket/660

Users of ``scipy.interpolate.interp1d`` may need to revise their code
if it relies on the incorrect behavior.

Running Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are moving away from having our own testing framework and are
adopting `nose <http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/>`.

Building SciPy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for NumScons has been added. NumScons is a tentative new
build system for NumPy/SciPy, using scons at its core.
