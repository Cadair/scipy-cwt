SciPy is an open source library developed by Enthought, Inc. Many people have 
contributed to SciPy, both in code development, suggestions, and financial 
support.  Below is a partial list.  If you've been left off, please let me know
(eric@enthought.com), and I'll add your name.

Code Contributions:

The main developers on SciPy are Travis Oliphant, Pearu Peterson, and Eric 
Jones.  Travis and Eric each contributed about half the orginal code.  Pearu 
developed f2py which is the integral to wrapping the many Fortran libraries 
used in SciPy.  All three continually work on both algorithm development and 
improvements to the feature set, build process, and robustness of SciPy.


Prabhu Ramachandran -- improvements to gui_thread.
Jochen Kupper -- the zoom feature in plt.
Jeff Whitaker -- Mac OS X support.
Travis Vaught -- initial work on stats module clean up.
David M. Cooke  -- improvements to system_info, and lbfgsb wrapper
Chuck Harris -- Zeros package in optimize (1d root-finding algorithms)
Jean-Sebastien Roy -- fmin_tnc code which he adapted from Stephen Nash's 
                       original Fortran
Ed Schofield -- sparse adaptation and improvements
Robert Cimrman -- umfpack wrapper for sparse

Testing:

David Morrill for getting the scoreboard test system up and running.
Louis Luangkesorn for providing multiple tests for the stats module.

Website Development:

Travis Vaught, Tiffany Kamm, and Eric Jones for building the community web-site.
Travis Vaught for maintaining the web-site.

Institutions:

Enthought for providing resources and finances for development of SciPy.

Brigham Young University has provided resources for students to work on SciPy.

Agilent has given a genereous donation for support of SciPy.
