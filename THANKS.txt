SciPy is an open source library developed by Enthought, Inc. Many people have 
contributed to SciPy, both in code development, suggestions, and financial 
support.  Below is a partial list.  If you've been left of, please let me know, 
and we'll add your name.

Code Contributions:

The main developers on SciPy are Travis Oliphant, Pearu Peterson, and Eric 
Jones.  Travis and Eric each contributed about half the orginal code.  Pearu 
developed f2py which is the integral to wrapping the many Fortran libraries 
used in SciPy.  All three continually work algorithm development and 
improvements to the feature set, build process, and robustness of SciPy.


Prabhu Ramachandran -- improvements to gui_thread.
Jochen Kupper -- the zoom feature in plt.
Jeff Whitaker -- Mac OS X support.
Travis Vaught -- initial work on stats module clean up.
David M. Cooke  -- improvements to system_info
